## 💸Applications

>How can your project do its part in solving a real-life problem? What are its possible applications? Can it be monetized? Describe here.
>It is challenging to find a centralized, trustworthy evidence-based resource for drug information and drug interactions. Our website provides a single reliable digital resource that gives all the details of a single medicine at one place.
>Also, our website offers suggestions for the best drug to cure a health condition which is a rare feature.
>MyPharmacy offers suggestions on generic drugs to cure a health condition. This feature has not been seen to be implemented on any website so far.
>Pharmacies generate data with every prescription. This data contains valuable information: who is prescribing, which medications, who is paying for them, what quantities and days supply, and much more. It is pharma manufacturers are most interested in this information. There are other interested parties such as research firms, payers, and clinicians. The data that is helpful to companies isn’t patient-specific data. Instead, they are interested in market-level data. Market-level pharmacy data is the specific data related to the script, not the patient. This data can be freely bought and sold without worrying about violating any privacy rules.
